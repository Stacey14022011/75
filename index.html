        <p class="text-muted">My school campus is very large with two multi-storey buildings. The two big gardens on both sides of the main gate make the entrance greener. Before the main building, we have a vehicle stand which is divided into two sections, one for teachers and another for students. The first section that you will find while entering the school is the reception. You can collect any information related to the school and children from there.</p>

It has a sound-proof system in it such that any voice or sound in it does not echo awfully.It is situated in the main building in the centre of the school. It has five doors and a number of windows. It is air-conditioned but has electric fans also which are put to work if ever the AC system fails. They are also worked with a generator when there is an electric breakdown and the AC system does not work.</p>
